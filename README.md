## 😁 About me

<br>

<h3 align='center'>I'm Robin DELAYRE and I'm a young french Full-Stack Developper</h3>

I'm currently 17 years old. I started coding since my ninth grade.  
I started coding because my middle-school introduced an optional class where they introduced the basics of Python, Html and CSS.  
One of our main project was to replace some pixels by another color to calculate the size of a [blob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physarum_polycephalum).  
We did that for the [CNES](https://cnes.fr/en), especially for [Audrey Dussutour](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Dussutour) who's famous because of her work on the blob.
