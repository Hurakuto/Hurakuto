## 😁 About me

<br>

<h3 align='center'>I'm Robin DELAYRE and I'm a young french Full-Stack Developper</h3>

I'm currently 17 years old. I started coding since my ninth grade.  
I started coding because my middle-school introduced an optional class where they introduced the basics of Python, Html and CSS.  

> [!NOTE]
> *Currently in first year at Coda school in Orléans (France).*
